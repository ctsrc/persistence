//!
//! ## Advisory locking
//!
//! POSIX advisory locks are not without problems. See for example
//! [this comment in the source code of SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/src/artifact/c230a7a24?ln=994-1081)
//! for a good write-up about the kinds of problems the developers
//! of SQLite see with POSIX advisory locks, and some pitfalls that
//! one should be aware of.
//!
//! The persistence library is aimed at a particular group of use-cases
//! where POSIX advisory locks happen to be suitable. It is imperative
//! then, that would-be users of the persistence library are aware of
//! what that group of use-cases is. In the section that follows, we
//! write a bit about just that; who and what this library is for.
//!
//! ## Who and what this library is for
//!
//! TODO: Write about who and what the library is for.
//!
//! ## Caveats or, some things to keep in mind
//!
//! This library makes use of POSIX advisory locks on Unix platforms.
//!
//! TODO: Write about how to use the library correctly.
//!
